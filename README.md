# Last_Pencil_Game
Last pencil game project from JetBrains academy.
This game consists of making your rival take the last pencil on the board.

First you define the number of pencils with which you are going to play and then the name of the players and the order. Then, in each shift, 1 to 3 pencils are removed until they reach zero. 
Whoever removes the last one loses.
